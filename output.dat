They are domains\nwhere multiple independent customers/tenants are serving content with\na shared public suffix, and thus where cross-hostname cookie sharing\nis not desirable from a security or end-user privacy perspective.\nSome of these domains are covered by Akamai-managed wildcard TLS\ncertificates.\n\nFor example, some of these are common patterns where\n\"foo\" and \"bar\" are hostnames from unrelated customers:\n\n* \"foo.akamaized.net\" and \"bar.akamaized.net\"\n* \"example.foo.com.edgesuite.net\" and \"example.bar.com.edgesuite.net\"\n* \"example.foo.akadns.net\" and \"example.bar.akadns.net\"\n\nWe published a customer-facing public blog post explaining\nto our customers why we are adding these domains to the PSL:\n\nhttps://www.akamai.com/blog/developers/adding-akamai-shared-domains-to-the-public-suffix-list\n\nNote that the \"-staging\" and \"test.edgekey.net\" domains are\nall customer-facing environments which have the same\nproperties of multiple customers sharing a suffix.\n\nAll of these domains are mission-critical production domains\nand we do not intend to ever let their registrations lapse.\n\nNumber of users this request is being made to serve:\nAltogether, these hostnames are involved in serving many\ntrillions of HTTP(S) requests per day."

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR.

For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR.

However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590.

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR. Apart from comment lines, this is a 0-line PR.\n\nDNS Verification via dig\n=======\n\nAs no new suffixes are being added, there are no DNS checks to perform.\n\nResults of Syntax Checker (`make test`)\n=========\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to expand</summary>\n\n```\ncd linter;                                \\\n./pslint_selftest.sh;                     \\\n./pslint.py

However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future.

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR. Apart from comment lines, this is a 0-line PR.\n\nDNS Verification via dig\n=======\n\nAs no new suffixes are being added, there are no DNS checks to perform.\n\nResults of Syntax Checker (`make

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR. Apart from comment lines, this is a 0-line PR.\n\nDNS Verification via dig\n=======\n\nAs no new suffixes are being added, there are no DNS checks to perform.\n\nResults of Syntax Checker (`make test`)\n=========\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to expand</summary>\n\n```\ncd linter;                                \\\n./pslint_selftest.sh;                     \\\n./pslint.py

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR. Apart from comment lines, this is a 0-line PR.\n\nDNS Verification via dig\n=======\n\nAs no new suffixes are being added, there are no DNS checks to perform.\n\nResults of Syntax Checker (`make

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR.

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR. Apart from comment lines, this is a 0-line PR.\n\nDNS Verification via dig\n=======\n\nAs no new suffixes are being added, there are no DNS checks to perform.\n\nResults of Syntax Checker (`make

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR. Apart from comment lines, this is a 0-line PR.\n\nDNS Verification via dig\n=======\n\nAs no new suffixes are being added, there are no DNS checks to perform.\n\nResults of Syntax Checker (`make

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR. Apart from comment lines, this is a 0-line PR.\n\nDNS Verification via dig\n=======\n\nAs no new suffixes are being added, there are no DNS checks to perform.\n\nResults of Syntax Checker (`make test`)\n=========\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to expand</summary>\n\n```\ncd linter;                                \\\n./pslint_selftest.sh;                     \\\n./pslint.py

//! aph3rson: "Use CentralNic model for Amazon suffixes" "Overview\n====\n\nPreviously, #1460 describes a need to organize Amazon domains on the PSL.\n\nIn this PR, we've added no new suffixes. However, we've made the following changes to our records on the PSL:\n\n- **CentralNic model**\nWe've moved to the so-called \"CentralNic model\" for large organizations, [with an added trailer](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/1460#issuecomment-1017955653).\n\n- **References**\nWe've added references to sections for our existing services, a practice that we started in #1590. This is an opaque GUID, but is something we use within Amazon to track internal requests for PSL entries.\n\n- **Service Naming**\nServices have been corrected to use the name described on their product page. This name either begins with `AWS`, `Amazon`, or just the service name. For example, [EC2's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) uses `Amazon EC2`,\nwhereas [ELB's product page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) shows a name of `Elastic Load Balancing`.\n\n- **Amazon Subsidiaries**\nConsidering all Amazon entities, AWS is expected to be our primary entity which posts suffixes to the PSL. However, some Amazon-but-not-AWS presence on the PSL is expected. At present, this is limited to [eero](https://eero.com/) and their Dynamic DNS system, but there may be more in the future. Such entries will be in the same section as AWS suffixes, under a unified Amazon section of the PSL.\n\nServices/Features in PR:\n====\n\nNo new suffixes included in this PR. Apart from comment lines, this is a 0-line PR.\n\nDNS Verification via dig\n=======\n\nAs no new suffixes are being added, there are no DNS checks to perform.\n\nResults of Syntax Checker (`make

//! ngsw: "Add 9 BASE, Inc. domains to private section" "# Description of Organization\nOrganization Website: https://binc.jp/\n\nMy name is Yuya NAGASAWA, I'm SRE at BASE.\n\nBASE, Inc. is based on the mission \"Payment to the People, Power to the People.\"　Our goal is to democratize payment, by various means including providing access to various payment methods and financing methods, as well as through our e-commerce platform, \"BASE\". Our focus is to empower individuals and small teams and enable them transform their abilities into value.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nOur e-commerce platform, \"BASE\", enables merchants to use subdomains such as \"base.ec\" and \"buyshop.jp\", at no cost. Many of our merchants use these subdomains instead of acquiring their own domains. However, due to the impact of Apple iOS 14.5, shops using our subdomains are currently unable to obtain conversion data from their Instagram Ads (in other words, they are unable to monitor the performance of their ads). We would like to solve this issue through registering to the PSL.\n\nThis is a pull request in response to the Apple iOS 14.5 change that affected Facebook Pixel tracking functionality for the domain(s) in the change, and we seek to resolve the impacts to the best of our ability to do so. Both Apple and Facebook support Public Suffix List for Private Click Measurement and Aggregated Event Measurement respectively.\n\n* We have reviewed the wiki here outlining the PSL and understand what it is and is not.\n* We have reviewed this matter with the team at Facebook, we are now fully aware about the consequences to the change we are requesting as it relates to cookies or other services, and choose to proceed in submitting this PR. We understand that despite reviewing the matter with Facebook, Facebook cannot control which use cases get accepted to the PSL\n* We understand that there is not any urgency and should this PR be merged to include our requested change, that there is no control over the timing of this change being updated downstream in browsers, libraries, certificate authorities or other systems or processes that incorporate the PSL.\n* We understand that if we later want to back out this change, there is also no guarantee that this will occur in a rapid fashion due to the same lack of control over browser, library, certificate authority, or other system or process changes."

//! krm3: "added *.bwcloud-os-instance.de" "# Description of Organization\nbwCloud-OS is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform developed and operated specifically to support research and teaching within Baden-Württemberg (federal state of Germany). Its operation is a joint initiative of four universities. Members of the currently 22 participating universities — including students, researchers, and administrative staff — are eligible to use bwCloud-OS to run their own virtual machines.\n\nMy name is Klara Mall, I am the head of the Network Department at the Scientific Computing Center (SCC) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and serve as the technical contact for all DNS-related topics within the bwCloud-OS platform. Scientific Computing Center (SCC) is also the owner of the domain bwcloud-os-instance.de.\n\n**Organization Website:**\nhttps://bwcloud-os.de\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nEach virtual machine or other service deployed using the IaaS infrastructure is provided with a location-specific *.{ka,ul,ma,fr}.bwcloud-os-instance.de subdomain, e.g. project-xyz.ka.bwcloud-os-instance.de. Since these subdomains are controlled by different users, we need *.bwcloud-os-instance.de to be on the PSL to ensure that cookies are restricted to the individual subdomains and cannot be set for the main or location-specific domains.\n\nFurthermore, inclusion on the PSL serves as an additional signal that these subdomains are run by different entities. For instance, in the case of fraud or abuse, it should ideally limit any corrective action (such as Google Safe Browsing flagging content as dangerous or denylisting by public resolver operators) to a specific subdomain (*.{ka,ul,ma,fr}.bwcloud-os-instance.de, e.g. project-xyz.ka.bwcloud-os-instance.de) instead of the entire location-specific domains, like ka.bwcloud-os-instance.de or ka.bwcloud-os-instance.de.\n\n**Registration validity of 2y+**\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to maintain 2 years of renaming validity for the domain bwcloud-os-instance.de as our registry DENIC eG does not allow to prolong de domains beyond the point they are already prolonged. The domain is set to automatically renew. We can affirm that we will keep this in place. Of course, we will keep `_psl` RRs in place. Please also note that expiration dates are not public for de domains.\nThere have been several cases with .de domains in the PSL; one reference MR is #2492.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nThe previous generation of the IaaS platform had more than 1,000 users. The new generation of the IaaS platform will be accessible for students, teachers, and researchers from all universities in Baden-Württemberg. It is estimated that the platform will grow quickly and reach more than 1,000 active users within the first year."

//! sidot3291: "Add Clerk user domains" "# Description of Organization\nClerk provides user authentication as a service to developers.\n\nOrganization Website: https://www.clerk.dev\n\nI am the founder and CEO of Clerk.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nOur domains should be in the PSL for both cookie security and to mitigate Let's Encrypt issuance limits.\n\nOur service relies on us sharing a domain with our user so we can set cookies on their behalf.  For example, if their app is hosted on `www.example.com`, we will host our service on `accounts.example.com`.  With this structure, `accounts.example.com` can set a cookie with `Domain=example.com;` and `www.example.com` will be able to read it.\n\nTo mirror this behavior in development and staging environments, we provide subdomains on `*.lcl.dev` and `*.stg.dev` respectively.  As an example, if a user is running a Widget Factory we may tunnel their localhost to `www.widget-factory.a12.lcl.dev`, and we will host our service at `accounts.widget-factory.a12.lcl.dev`.  The token `a12` in this case is simply an extra, random level of namespacing.  It allows multiple Widget Factory team members to use the same 2 left-most parts while still keeping cookies separate.  This is also why we have a wildcard in our PSL request.\n\nThis pull request ensures that our users will not be able to set cookies on `lcl.dev` nor `*.lcl.dev`, and will keep their Cookie-Writing privileges properly scoped to the left-most parts of the domains we issue.  It will also allow us to issue up to 50 Let's Encrypt certificates for each development and staging environment (in the example above, `a12.lcl.dev` would be treated as a public suffix and `widget-factory.a12.lcl.dev` would be treated as a domain with an independent limit)."

//! sidot3291: "Add Clerk user domains" "# Description of Organization\nClerk provides user authentication as a service to developers.\n\nOrganization Website: https://www.clerk.dev\n\nI am the founder and CEO of Clerk.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nOur domains should be in the PSL for both cookie security and to mitigate Let's Encrypt issuance limits.\n\nOur service relies on us sharing a domain with our user so we can set cookies on their behalf.  For example, if their app is hosted on `www.example.com`, we will host our service on `accounts.example.com`.  With this structure, `accounts.example.com` can set a cookie with `Domain=example.com;` and `www.example.com` will be able to read it.\n\nTo mirror this behavior in development and staging environments, we provide subdomains on `*.lcl.dev` and `*.stg.dev` respectively.  As an example, if a user is running a Widget Factory we may tunnel their localhost to `www.widget-factory.a12.lcl.dev`, and we will host our service at `accounts.widget-factory.a12.lcl.dev`.  The token `a12` in this case is simply an extra, random level of namespacing.  It allows multiple Widget Factory team members to use the same 2 left-most parts while still keeping cookies separate.  This is also why we have a wildcard in our PSL request.\n\nThis pull request ensures that our users will not be able to set cookies on `lcl.dev` nor `*.lcl.dev`, and will keep their Cookie-Writing privileges properly scoped to the left-most parts of the domains we issue.  It will also allow us to issue up to 50 Let's Encrypt certificates for each development and staging environment (in the example above, `a12.lcl.dev` would be treated as a public suffix and `widget-factory.a12.lcl.dev` would be treated as a domain with an independent limit)."

Our primary target demographic is the worldwide diaspora of Scots. The services we provide include:\n\n* Domain registration across a broad range of gTLDs and ccTLDs\n* DNS management with fast name server propagation\n* WHOIS privacy (where permitted)\n* Web hosting services\n* A dedicated email service\n\n**Organization Website:** https://domains.scot\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nTo expand on our domain offerings we're now allowing the registration of subdomains. Listing it in the PSL ensures each client’s subdomain is treated as an independent registrable boundary, preventing cross-tenant cookie and storage leakage and mitigating risks like session fixation or credential exposure. It aligns with PSL PRIVATE section goals for multi-client security and privacy, supports least‑scope certificate automation (eg per-client ACME), and reinforces compliance by isolating user data. This request is purely for security and isolation-not to bypass tracking, attribution, or third‑party limits.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nApproximately 14000 (currently)"

These have been known to range in scale from IoT devices to rack-mountable servers, often running a web server and/or other interactive user-facing services.\n\nFrom a security point of view, these network devices/services are **mutually distrustful**, having been brought to EMF by people who are most likely to be strangers to each other.  While there is no commercial model to consider, the security model for EMF is similar to that of a shared/cloud hosting provider, where our 'customers' are not expected to maintain high levels of mutual trust.\n\nWe therefore intend for the PSL inclusion of `at.emf.camp` to establish isolation between direct subdomains, where implemented (e.g. in browser cookies), and to signify the intended security boundaries between its subdomains wherever the PSL is used by third parties to do so."

//! ekerfelt: "Add encr.app and lp.dev subdomains" "# Description of Organization\n**Organization Website:**\nhttps://encore.cloud/\n\nEncore is a developer platform for building cloud-hosted backend and soon full-stack web applications. We provide users with a unique $MYAPP.encoreapi.com and $MYAPP.encr.app subdomain that they can use to host their application on. We are now expanding this use case to providing support for more content-specific user-generated applications under new subdomains, which will be hosted under objects.lp.dev, api.lp.dev and frontend.encr.app, hence the addition to the PSL.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe will provide managed hosting for user-generated web applications under subdomains of api.lp.dev, objects.lp.dev and frontend.encr.app . Inclusion in the PRIVATE section of the PSL is necessary to ensure proper security and domain handling, specifically for cookie security.\n\nWithout inclusion in the PSL, browsers may treat these subdomains (representing distinct end-user applications) as all part a single-origin domain, allowing cookies to be shared between them. This presents a security risk, as one user’s site could access another user’s cookies. Inclusion in the PSL ensures that each subdomain is treated as a separate site, preventing cross-user cookie access.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nThese new domains being added is for a sibling project to our existing user-base of the encr.app domain.

//! marcel-d-encoway: "Add encoway domain: eu.encoway.cloud" "# Description of Organization\nOrganization Website: https://www.encoway.de/en/\nencoway GmbH provides companies from the manufacturing industry with CPQ software.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nFor each installation our clients get a subdomain of eu.encoway.cloud so they can access their system via web without having to incure additional fees for domains, static IP address or dyndns as this is handled by our system. Since each installation belongs to a separated legal entity and deals with that entity valuable information, security is top concern for us and our clients. It has proven that having the subdomains recognized by the browsers as separate domains and not share cookies or other vital information is a good working practice."

Stichting is just the Dutch word for Foundation, and NOG stands for Network Operator Group. Network Operator Groups are often run by volunteers and often not registered as a legal entity. they are places where network operators and engineers meet to share experiences and learn from each other. We provide free services to NOGs like web and email hosting, online conferencing tools, file sharing tools etc. so that they can concentrate on helping their community without having to worry about maintaining their own servers and tools.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe use the domain `nog.community` exclusively to host websites for NOGs that don't have their own domain. Therefore we think it is prudent to list nog.community as a public suffix as each subdomain under it is used by a different entity. They should not set/see cookies for other NOGs.\n\nThe nog.community domain is on a 3-year renewal and currently registered until 2024-10-11."

If the DNS validation below is insufficient I can also be contacted at admin@heliohost.org\n\nOrganization Website:\n\nhttps://heliohost.org\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nThe reason we're submitting this addition to the PSL is because quite a few services such as antivirus and social platforms incorrectly assume that all subdomains of helioho.st and heliohost.us belong to the same person and, for instance, if one website gets hacked, thousands of unrelated websites also get banned by these services because they don't realize that each subdomain is a different user. By submitting our domains to this list we're hoping that will be less likely to happen.\n\nhelioho.st currently expires on 2026-06-18 (2 years and 10 months)\nheliohost.us currently expires on 2025-10-20 (2 years and 2 months)\n\nWe intend to continue renewing both of the above domains indefinitely. HelioHost is not a temporary project, and we have no intention of ever stopping providing free hosting.\n\nWe have already contacted Let's Encrypt directly and they approved our request to secure up to 500 subdomains on helioho.st and 500 subdomains on heliohost.us per week.\n\nWe have had quite a few users contact us asking if it would be possible to proxy their helioho.st or heliohost.us domain through Cloudflare. Our current policy is to tell them that they have to buy a domain or use a free registrar such as eu.org in order to use Cloudflare's service. If each subdomain is recognized by Cloudflare as a separate user this would be an added bonus to our users, but is definitely not the primary reason for this pull request.\n\nWe are not trying to circumvent any third party limitations.\n\nNumber of users this request is being made to serve:\n\nWe currently have 3230 users, but we are growing rapidly. Users aren't limited to one helioho.st or heliohost.us domain either."

Users are then able to deploy their web apps and websites to a subdomain owned by Hercules, or to a domain owned by the user. The Hercules platform is actively used by developers, solopreneurs, businesses, large enterprises, and non-technical who want to build a web app without coding.\n\nThis request is being submitted by Brendan Falk (https://linkedin.com/in/brendanfalk), founder and CEO of Hercules. The legal name of the company that makes the product, Hercules, is \"Zeus AI Labs, Inc.\"\n\n**Organization Website:**\n\nhttps://hercules.app\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nHercules provides managed hosting for user-generated web applications on subdomains of the following domains:\n* onhercules.app for production\n* hercules-app.com for development and production\n* hercules-dev.com for development\n\nWe are seeking inclusion in private section of the PSL as we believe it is necessary to achieve the following:\n\n1. Cookie Security: Without PSL inclusion, browsers may treat the above domains as a single-origin domain, potentially allowing cookies to be shared between different user subdomains. This presents a security risk\n2. Browser and Platform Compatibility: Many platforms and services (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Let’s Encrypt, Cloudflare) use the PSL to define domain boundaries. Listing the above domains in the PSL ensures compatibility with modern security policies.\n\nHercules commits to\n1. maintaining its _psl DNS TXT records\n2. ensuring ongoing compliance with PSL guidelines\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\n\nWe have ~50,000 users. A user is an individual person who has created a Hercules account and created an app. Most users create 1-2 apps. Every app is given a development domain that turns off after 10 min of inactivity. Approx 5-10% our users publish their apps to the prod domain. We expect this % to increase over time."

//! opiedelivers: "Homebase requested the addition of id.pub kin.one kin.pub" "# Description of Organization\nHomebase is a non-profit, open-source project, focused on safeguarding human rights online. Our mission is to empower individuals with the ability to establish their unique online identities, each anchored by its own domain name and certificate.\nHomebase is both completely decentralized and integrates seamlessly with existing Internet technologies, allowing users to host their own web pages, post blogs, engage in social networking, and use services like true peer-to-peer chat clients and personal image libraries.\n\nOur commitment to decentralized user control over personal data and online privacy is uncompromising. As part of this commitment, we employ zero-knowledge encryption. This means that user data is not just encrypted but is structured in such a way that only the user can decrypt and access their information - even Homebase cannot access this data.\nWe aim to pioneer a new era of a decentralized internet, one where knowledge, privacy, and genuine social connections are paramount.\n\nOrganization website: [https://www.homebase.id/]( https://www.homebase.id/)\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nHomebase is designed with an individual-centric approach, empowering users with privacy and control over their own data. While we encourage users to secure their own unique domain names, we also offer free subdomains (e.g., username.id.pub, firstname.lastname.kin.one, username.pub.one). This ensures that secure online identities remain accessible to those who may not afford or be able to manage their own domain names.\n\nThese identities are all distinct and are isolated from one another to ensure privacy and security. For this reason, in Homebase's model, certificates, cookies and any site data set on one “subdomain” (user identity) is not readable or accessible by another user identity on the same subdomain. Identities on the same subdomain might be hosted on the same or on different servers.\n\nThe inclusion of these domains in the Public Suffix List is critical for Homebase to maintain this high level of user privacy and data security. It would significantly enhance the reach and trustworthiness of our platform and align with our mission of providing a personal, secure, private space on the Internet.\n\nThe domains \"id.pub\", \"kin.one\", and \"pub.one\" are registered with a commitment to the long-term vision of the project, intending to extend the availability of secure online identities to as many individuals as possible. We hope over time that many ISPs will also begin to offer such subdomains to Homebase users that they host.\n\nHomebase is built with the ability for users to freely move their hosted solution, even hosting themselves, which is a unique feature not commonly seen in conventional platforms. Being a true peer-to-peer system, Homebase significantly differs from typical internet platforms and requires distinct user privacy and security considerations.\n\nThe request is being made by an administrator, advocating for the rights and privacy of potential users of the Homebase platform. Administrator email: [info@homebase.id](mailto:info@homebase.id)\n\nNumber of users this request is being made to serve: Estimating 50,000 actual individual users per domain."

Each subdomain of the `hypernode.io` is a separate customer running an e-commerce platform. While the subdomains, such as `example.hypernode.io`, are not meant to be used in production, misconfigurations may inadvertedly make them accessible.\nA secondary reason is that third party systems for SEO optimisation, advertisement, etc, have been known to display to a users of their system all data gathered from both their own subdomain, but also other subdomains not associated with this user. The most recent issue here was Google Tag Manager's \"tagcoverage\" overview showing links from one customer's subdomain to another customer.\n\nWe have been using this `hypernode.io` subdomain setup for approximately 10 years, and we have no intentions at all to change this system. The assumption of the `hypernode.io` subomain is integrated into our entire codebase, documentation, and is well known by our customer base of many years.

Previous requests for our organization have been submitted by me or my co-worker Mario Hoberg, a senior engineer at IServ GmbH.\n\n**Organization Website:** https://iserv.de/\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe deploy IServ on-premise and cloud hosted under unique customer domains. For technical reasons, we need a static hostname for installations that cannot change. Since customers can request their end-user visible domains to change, we registered iserv.host as a domain we can provide static aliases with.\n\nHostnames will have the format %UUID%.iserv.host and are used in the background to connect servers to each other.\n\nSince customers have full control of their servers and DNS zones, we must isolate them from each other. This is why we would like the domain to be added to the PSL.\n\nSome protocols, e.g. [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) will make use of this hostname in customer facing applications, so it's important to us that e.g. cookies remain separate.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible for us at this time to maintain 1 year of validity and provide 2 years of renaming validity for our existing de domains on the list. Our registrar INWX does not allow us to prolong de domains beyond the point they are already prolonged as far as I can tell.

K. is a performance‑focused manufacturer, emphasizing an optimized, modular operating system (KeeneticOS). K. has millions of users worldwide and has launched several dozen device models since its founding.\n\nThis pool request is posted at the initiative of the KeeneticOS development team, as we understand that it is necessary for the correct operation of our system for end-users.\n\n**Organization Website:**\nhttps://keenetic.com\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nKeenetic provides a per-device dynamic DNS service (KeenDNS), so that each device subdomain behaves like an independent site `customer123.keenetic.link` or `home456.keenetic.pro`. This is where the reasons for PSL inclusion come from.\n1. Cookie isolation (prevent cookie leakage across users).\n1. Preventing cross‑user CSRF and SameSite confusion.\n1. Correct origin and storage partitioning in browsers.\n1. Avoidance of cross‑user privilege escalation via shared domain state, or accidental credential sharing.\n1. Rejection of parent registry-level wildcard certificates like `*.keenetic.link`; pushing Keenetic toward per‑subdomain certificates (which is already the case).\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nRoughly, 4 million users (devices) for `keenetic.io` domain and 400k for other three domains, as `keenetic.io` is by default assigned to every device, and other domains may be manually booked by the users."

//! kevvthegoat: "Add ae.kg to Public Suffix List" "# Description of Organization\nKevin Service operate a free subdomain registration service that allows users to register subdomains under our managed public domains. The service provides DNS management and free web hosting for registered subdomains. Our platform includes administrative tools for monitoring domain health, including automated VirusTotal scanning to detect malicious subdomains and sensitive content scanning to identify policy violations. We actively manage abuse by suspending problematic subdomains and tracking user activity through fingerprinting and IP correlation to prevent multi-account abuse.\n\n**About the Submitter:**\n\nI am the sole developer and operator of this subdomain registration service. I built and maintain the full stack—backend API, frontend dashboard, admin panel, and automated security scanning scripts. As the operator, I am responsible for all technical decisions, domain management, abuse prevention, and this PSL submission. This submission is made to ensure proper domain cookie isolation and accurate public suffix recognition for subdomains registered through our service.\n\n**Organization Website:**\nFree Hosting:\nhttps://kevsrv.me/\nDomain Registry:\nhttps://registry.kevsrv.me/\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\n**Purpose for PSL Inclusion:**\nAt Kevin Service, we provide subdomains to independent users who run their own websites and applications under our parent domains. Because these users are unrelated and operate separately, their subdomains need to function as distinct security boundaries. PSL inclusion ensures that cookies, credentials, and browser storage remain isolated between users, and it restores consistent behavior across major platforms like iOS/Apple systems, Cloudflare, Let’s Encrypt, password managers, and other services that rely on PSL data. This request aligns with the intended purpose of the PSL and isn’t meant to bypass any vendor policies or rate limits.\n\nWe also confirm long-term domain ownership and active renewal management, with registration terms exceeding two years and maintained with more than one year remaining at all times. This is our first request for PSL inclusion, and doing so will improve safety, reliability, and standards compliance across the Kevin Service namespace—protecting authentication, storage, and session integrity for everyone who uses our platform.\n\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"576\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b63134e-be49-4ec3-ae59-7ca46945a2ec\" />\n\n**Domain Abuse Monitoring:** We perform periodic checks on all subdomains — including those discovered through SSL certificate issuance logs — against VirusTotal and our internal sensitive content database to ensure users are not violating our TOS or UAP. If our automated system detects any malicious activity, the domain will be suspended.\n- Checkout https://registry.kevsrv.me/analytics/ for our public analytics.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\n~600"

Similarily, Laravel Vapor has been providing users with an *.on-vapor.com domain for a few months now.\n\nSee [forge.laravel.com](https://forge.laravel.com) and [vapor.laravel.com](https://vapor.laravel.com) for information specific to these products.\n\n**Organization Website:** [laravel.com](https://laravel.com)\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nLaravel provides managed hosting for user-generated web applications under subdomains. We would like to get included in the private section of the PSL to ensure proper security and domain handling.\n\n* Cookie Security: Without inclusion in the PSL, browsers may treat Laravel Forge and Vapor domains as a single-origin domain, potentially allowing cookies to be shared between different user subdomains. This presents a security risk, as one user’s site could access another user’s cookies. Inclusion in the PSL ensures that each subdomain is treated as a separate site, preventing cross-user cookie access.\n* Browser and Platform Compatibility: Many platforms and services (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Let’s Encrypt, Cloudflare) use the PSL to define domain boundaries. Listing our Laravel Forge and Vapor domains in the PSL ensures compatibility with modern security policies.\n\nLaravel commits to maintaining its _psl DNS TXT records and ensuring ongoing compliance with PSL guidelines.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\n\n- Laravel Forge - We're still in the process of building the new features into Forge, but all newly created applications will be given a free *.on-forge.com domain. We anticipate this to quickly ramp up to thousands of domains.\n- Laravel Vapor - Vapor already actively uses on-vapor.com and is already serving over thousands of domains.\n\nAll customers are paying customers."

//! lann: "Add `user.localcert.dev`" "# Description of Organization\nOrganization Website: https://localcert.dev\n\nI am an individual providing a public service for software developers to simplify development and testing of TLS services. Localcert is a CLI tool and hosted service that provides developers with an experience similar to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), but for local networks and without proxying.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nLocalcert works in tandem with an ACME service provider (i.e. Let's Encrypt, though other RFC8555-compliant providers should work) to provide a developer with a unique user domain and certificate that looks like `*.r5pemzugjz27crch5n3v4d7wh3r62xxwytbolbek5x7py.localcert.dev` that can be used to resolve local network addresses with domain names of the form `ip10-11-12-13.r5pemzugjz27crch5n3v4d7wh3r62xxwytbolbek5x7py.user.localcert.dev`. Inclusion in the PSL would prevent cookies from crossing between user domains and allow each user to have a separate Let's Encrypt rate limit bucket.\n\n_This dynamic IP resolution may appear to violate the first [Non-Acceptance Factor](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines#validation-and-non-acceptance-factors)_, but I think the design of Localcert makes it an acceptable exception:\n\n> We do not accept entries for use as DNS wildcards, such that e.g. 1-2-3-4.foo.tld resolves as IP address 1.2.3.4. This basically projects the security properties of the IP address space onto the domain name space, and we don't feel that is safe. IP addresses can be dynamically allocated to multiple mutually-untrusting parties; domain names generally are not.\n\n* The Localcert DNS server only resolves [reserved IPv4 addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses#IPv4): private networks (e.g. 192.168.0.0/16), loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/8), and link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16).\n* Because these addresses aren't publicly routed, users cannot obtain a ACME certificate with the [HTTP or TLS challenges](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/). Instead, the Localcert server assists in DNS-01 challenge validation.\n* Localcert generates the user domain (`<user_hash>.user.localcert.dev`) by hashing the user's ACME Account URL (e.g. ` https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/12345` for Let's Encrypt). This Account URL is authenticated as part of the DNS-01 challenge validation by proxying a replay-resistant [signed ACME request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-6.5) from the client to the ACME server.\n\nThis security model means that only the ACME account holder can obtain a certificate for their specific user domain. I believe this addresses the rationale behind the non-acceptance factor. If there are still concerns I very much want to discuss - I don't want to run a public service that makes the internet worse :slightly_smiling_face:."

This is especially useful for developers or users who want to quickly share their projects or applications for testing or collaboration purposes.\n\nKey Features of Localtonet:\nTunneling: Localtonet creates a secure tunnel to expose a locally running application to the internet with a publicly accessible URL, allowing remote access.\n\nSecure Access: Localtonet provides HTTPS support, ensuring encrypted and secure connections to the tunneled services.\n\nDevelopment and Testing: Developers can easily showcase their projects or test integrations with external APIs using Localtonet, without needing to deploy the application first.\n\nPort Forwarding: It allows forwarding of specific ports from a local machine to be accessible via the internet.\n\nIn summary, Localtonet accelerates development and testing processes by making local applications and services available to the internet.\n\nI am Burak ISLEYICI, one of the developers and co-founders of Localtonet, who informed you of this.\n\n**Organization Website:**\nhttps://localtonet.com\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nSecurity and Privacy Controls\nCookie Management\nAccurate URL Handling\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nThere are 96232 users registered on the Localtonet platform and it has been serving in the Tunneling sector for approximately 3 years."

Specifically:\n\nCookie Isolation:\n- If our domains aren’t listed in the PSL, browsers may treat all user subdomains as part of a single origin. That could allow cookies set on one user’s environment to be readable by another, which is a clear security issue. Registering in the PSL ensures each user subdomain is recognized as its own site, preventing any cross-user cookie exposure.\n\nCompatibility With Modern Web Standards:\n- Browsers and infrastructure providers—such as Chrome, Firefox, Let’s Encrypt, and Cloudflare—rely on the PSL to determine site boundaries. Inclusion ensures that Magic Patterns’ domains behave consistently with current security expectations.\n\nAdditionally, users of Magic Patterns can create arbitrary cookies on their assigned domains, which makes proper domain separation via the PSL even more important.\n\nMagic Patterns will maintain its _psl DNS TXT records and remain in compliance with PSL requirements on an ongoing basis.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nCurrently hundreds of thousands of users."

//! sradevski: "Add medusajs.app domain to public list" "# Description of Organization\n[MedusaJS](https://medusajs.com/) is an open-source commerce platform made with customizability in mind. There is a corresponding **Medusa Cloud** solution that makes hosting and managing MedusaJS a lot easier for customers, that uses `medusajs.app` as the base domain. Each client receives a custom subdomain (eg. `myapp.medusajs.app`) per deployed environment, which is where the need for this submissions comes from.\n\nI (Stevche) am one of the core engineers working on building and managing Medusa Cloud.\n\n**Organization Website:**\n\nhttps://medusajs.com/\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nMedusa Cloud is a hosting solution for the MedusaJS project. It integrates with the customers' Git repositories and provides a CI/CD setup, taking care of hosting Medusa, a Postgres database, a Redis instance, and an S3-compatible file storage.\n\nAs part of each Medusa project, there can be multiple environments (eg. production, staging, etc.), and each of them gets their own unique subdomain (eg. `myapp.medusajs.app`). The endpoint hosts the API and admin panel for the MedusaJS app and is used as the API for building storefronts.\n\nAs Medusa is onboarding more customers, it's important that the root domain for these environments is part of the public suffix list.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\n\nCurrently around 50-60 subdomains, expected to grow to around 500-600 in the next 2-3 months at the current pace of onboarding customers."

When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\n\nOrganization Website: http://about.meta.com/\n\nI am a Software Engineer on the Security Foundations team at Meta.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\n`atmeta.com` will be used to host third-party marketing sites that market different products in the Meta portfolio of solutions on different subdomains, and we’d like to isolate the various third parties from each other, particularly as it relates to setting cookies and cookie consent.\n\nDifferent subdomains of “atmeta.com” will be operated by different marketing companies and agencies, so while the overall ownership of “atmeta.com” resides with Meta, it is undesirable to have shared cookies or storage across these subdomains as it could open up security issues for visitors to more than one of these marketing sites. For example, `connect.atmeta.com` might point to a third party’s event platform for hosting an in-person event while `news.atmeta.com` may point to another third party’s hosted wordpress platform that hosts news and blog content.\n\nWhile we will be endeavoring to secure these subdomains and vetting our marketing subdomain owners thoroughly, we would like to proceed to place “atmeta.com” on the Public Suffix List as well, as a cue to browser vendors to treat these sites independently.\n\nWe are aware of the time propagation delays, as well as the difficulties of later removing something from the Public Suffix List.\n\nNumber of users this request is being made to serve: We expect ~30-50 subdomains of atmeta.com over the next 24 months, with more continuously in the future. Based on current traffic to similar sites, we expect on the order of millions of viewers per month to these sites.\n\nNOTE: I have also consolidated the existing \"Facebook, Inc.\" record for \"apps.fbsbx.com\" (#110) under the \"Meta Platforms, Inc.\" section to keep things tidy, and will update the DNS verification there as well. If we'd prefer to keep these changes separate, let me know, and I'd be happy to split them up."

I manage infrastructure for Million and am submitting this request on behalf of the organization.\n\n**Organization Website:** https://same.new\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nIn order to protect users and enforce security boundaries between different tenants on the platform, we are requesting that several domain properties be included in the Public Suffix List.\n\n- `same-app.com`\n- `same-preview.com`\n\nSame hosts user-generated apps at dynamic subdomains such as `*.preview.same-app.com` and `*.same-assets.com`, and it is critical that cookies and other scoped data do not leak between tenants.\n\nThis domain behaves similarly to `replit.dev` or `github.io`, used by multiple unrelated users, and therefore requires public suffix treatment to prevent cross-origin data access. Without PSL inclusion, browser behavior around cookies and certificate issuance may lead to security vulnerabilities in a multi-tenant environment.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:** 20,000 (current)"

Users can build and publish web applications using natural language. Mocha takes care of the underlying infrastructure which includes supporting workers (API endpoints), databases, object storage, authentication, and more on behalf of our user's applications. Mocha has been around for close to a year, but recently launched a more fully featured version of the product which has led to a large increase in hosted applications.\n\nI (Ben Reinhart) am the CTO and co-founder of Mocha 👋🏻 .\n\n**Organization Website:**\n\nhttps://getmocha.com\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nGiven Mocha hosts mutually untrusting user-generated applications all under one domain, it's critical we do everything we can to ensure security isolation and strict boundaries exist between our users' apps. Inclusion in the PRIVATE section of the PSL helps ensure this isolation, particularly with respect to preventing unwanted cookie access across distinct applications. Adding Mocha's domains to the PSL keeps Mocha compatible with modern security best practices and protects our users.\n\nHere are the domains we're adding and what they're each used for:\n\n* `mocha.app` - hosts user apps in a production environment, e.g., `my-app.mocha.app`.\n* `mocha-sandbox.dev` - hosts user apps in a development environment, e.g., `<app-uuid>.mocha-sandbox.dev`.\n* `mochausercontent.com` - serves user-uploaded assets, like images, videos, or documents. E.g., `<app-uuid>.mochausercontent.com/cover-art.jpg`.\n\nEach of these domains are used only for the purposes described above. Each one on its own (eg `mocha.app`) is configured to redirect to our product at https://getmocha.com, where users can also find our privacy policy, platform rules, and contact information (including our abuse@getmocha.com and security@getmocha.com email addresses).\n\n`mocha.app` is registered until 2030. The other two domains are registered until 2035. We will keep these registered with  at least 2 years remaining. We are not attempting to work around third party limits. Mocha commits to maintaining its _psl DNS TXT records and an ongoing compliance with PSL guidelines.\n\nI've seen mention of `__Host`-prefixed cookies on other PRs here. Assuming I'm understanding correctly, we are unable to guarantee this as the applications running under our domains are user-generated and we do not control the code.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\n\n150k+ users and growing, ~40k hosted apps."

//! alstrasolutions: "Add `ngo.us` for the NGO.US Registry" "# Description of Organization\nOrganization Website: [https://client.ngo.us](https://client.ngo.us)\n\nThe \".NGO.US Registry\" is a not-for-profit division of [Alstra Solutions Ltd.](https://alstra.ca) ([AS212387](https://bgp.he.net/AS212387#_whois)), a server hosting and digital marketing company federally registered in Canada since 2020. The .NGO.US Registry, as a division of Alstra, will serve as a domain registry for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worldwide, providing a unique domain registration service. Our mission is to foster trust, enhance visibility, and bridge the digital divide for nonprofits.\n\nAs the Chief Information Officer of Alstra Solutions Ltd., I am submitting this PR on behalf of the \".NGO.US Registry\" to include our domain `ngo.us` in the Public Suffix List.\n\nWe are committed to supporting nonprofits by providing free .ngo.us domain names, aiming to empower NGOs and charities with authenticity, reach, and a distinct online identity.\n\nIncluding `ngo.us` in the Public Suffix List will benefit NGOs, charities, and nonprofit groups that will apply the `.ngo.us` domain names, especially in terms of cookies security.\n\nWe have carefully considered the potential impacts of this inclusion and understand the responsibility involved.\n\nI kindly request the review and consideration of our PR for the inclusion of ngo.us in the Public Suffix List. Thank you for your attention and support.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nThe inclusion of `ngo.us` in the Public Suffix List is necessary for several reasons related to cookie security, Let's Encrypt issuance, and Cloudflare account splitting:\n\n1. Let's Encrypt Issuance: Each domain under `ngo.us` will belong to a separate nonprofit organization. By being listed in the PSL, we can ensure that each nonprofit organization can obtain and manage its own Let's Encrypt certificate for its `ngo.us` subdomain using their standalone monthly limit. This separation allows for independent certificate issuance and renewal, enhancing the security and privacy of nonprofit organizations' websites.\n\n2. Cloudflare Account Splitting: With `ngo.us` domains, each subdomain will represent a separate nonprofit organization. By including `ngo.us` in the PSL, we enable nonprofit organizations to create and manage their own individual Cloudflare accounts for their respective `ngo.us` subdomains. This account splitting ensures that each organization has full control over their Cloudflare settings, including DNS management, caching, security features, and other cf services.\n\n3. **Cookie Security (the most important reason)**: The inclusion of `ngo.us` in the PSL is crucial for maintaining cookie security. With separate subdomains for each nonprofit organization, we can prevent cookies from being shared between different organizations' applications. This isolation enhances the security and privacy of user data, ensuring that sensitive information remains within the appropriate organizational context.\n\nNumber of users this request is being made to serve:\n\nWe aim to accommodate a significant number of nonprofit applicants in the future. We have already witnessed interest from nonprofits who have joined the waitlist, and as the waitlist continues to grow, the number of potential users for .ngo.us domains increases as well.\n\nOur domain `ngo.us` has been renewed and is currently valid until 2030-05-25.\n\n[WHOIS](https://www.whois.us/):\n\n```\nDomain Name: ngo.us\nRegistry Domain ID: D6147912-US\nRegistrar WHOIS Server: https://porkbun.com/whois\nRegistrar URL: www.porkbun.com\nUpdated Date: 2023-06-14T19:30:03Z\nCreation Date: 2004-05-26T15:04:59Z\nRegistry Expiry Date: 2030-05-25T23:59:59Z\n```"

This requires use of a domain with a TLD that is not on the HSTS preload list utilized by browsers (`.pro` is not on this list, whereas `.app` and `.dev`, the currently supported options on the ngrok platform, are).\n\nNumber of users this request is being made to serve:\n- More than 5 million developers currently (https://ngrok.com/customers)\n\nRegistration expiry is more than 2 years out:\n```\nngrok.pro   2026-07-20\n```\n\nExample Use-Cases:\n\nA developer wants to test the code running on their laptop with a system like Twilio that uses webhooks. The developer starts an ngrok agent locally and ngrok provides a public url which forwards encrypted traffic to the service running on their local machine. The developer can then configure Twilio to use that domain to call when an event occurs such as an incoming SMS message. A domain in that situation would look like `84c5df439d74.ngrok.dev`, or `3a5c10d67779.eu.ngrok.io` if the agent is configured to use the European region (one of seven regions available).\n\nThe user can then easily add [webhook verification](https://ngrok.com/docs/cloud-edge/modules/webhook) to make sure it is Twilio making the request, or add [basic-auth](https://blog.ngrok.com/posts/authentication-with-ngrok), [oauth](https://blog.ngrok.com/posts/how-to-secure-your-network-tunnels-with-oauth-fast), [mutual-TLS](https://ngrok.com/docs/ngrok-agent/ngrok#flags-12), [allow/deny CIDR ranges](https://ngrok.com/docs/ngrok-agent/ngrok#flags-12), and other features. More information is in the [Getting Started guide](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started), or this Twilio [\"6 awesome reasons to use ngrok when testing webhooks\"](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html) post.\n\nCustomers can also reserve specific subdomains instead of having them randomly assigned, which could look like `my-company.ngrok.app` or `webhook-development.ngrok.dev`.\n\nWith the addition of `ngrok.pro` to the ngrok service, paying customers who want to connect to their ngrok domain via browser using HTTP, not HTTPS, would be able to use a subdomain of `ngrok.pro`.\n\nEnterprise customers use ngrok to centrally manage and secure ingress for their many applications deployed across public cloud, serverless platforms, their own data center or Internet of Things devices. This article about the recent ngrok funding raise provides a nice overview: [techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/ngrok-a-service-to-help-devs-deploy-sites-services-and-apps-raises-50m](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/ngrok-a-service-to-help-devs-deploy-sites-services-and-apps-raises-50m/)"

(Comparable products include Github Pages and Squarespace). Each user can publish pages under their own unique `*.notion.site` domain, e.g. user A might publish `delightful-strawberry-123.notion.site` and user B might publish `lucky-stone-567.notion.site`).\n\nI am an engineer on the Trust Engineering team at Notion, which is a subteam of Security, and have been collaborating with the Notion Sites product team to de-risk our features and prevent abuse.\n\nOrganization Website: https://www.notion.so/\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe'd like `notion.site` to be on the PSL in order to:\n* Restrict these apps' use of cookies to their own personal subdomain. Even though Notion itself serves the pages for each subdomain (less custom code/javascript), this isolation guarantees security to each of our customers (e.g. in the case of some iframe exploit).\n* Avoid domain reputation from `a.notion.site` affecting that of `b.notion.site`, given that `a` and `b` are distinct content creators. This also seems to be best practice, given that similar site hosting platforms have entries in the PSL.\n\nOur domain ownership of `notion.site` was recently renewed and extends until Dec 8, 2027 (> 2 years from now).\n\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 2 28 24 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/assets/25401650/b8e41eb6-6b35-47b2-99e4-e2a0290d43f8\">\n\nNumber of users this request is being made to serve: There are ~5 million distinct \"workspaces\" that have published pages with their own `*.notion.site` domain, and we expect this to grow."

(Government of Canada registration number: 794834309 RC 0001) and its subsidiary ONID.\n\nWe provide B2C consumer products such as [link-in-bio](https://get.onid.ca/) and [site builder](https://create.onid.ca/signup.php), and on the B2B side, [enterprise solutions](https://get.onid.ca/enterprise-solutions/) services primarily targeted at Canadian businesses & organizations.\n\nOur clients can host websites, online store, ERP, CRM, LMS, and many other possible solutions, through a customizable `.onid.ca` subdomains on our platform OR on-premise.\n\nOur platform offers products + services including consumer-facing [ONID Site Builder](https://create.onid.ca/signup.php), [ONID Enterprise Solutions](https://get.onid.ca/enterprise-solutions/), and [ONID DesignPro](https://get.onid.ca/professional-website-design/), all of which provide users with personalized `.onid.ca` subdomains in the format of `{sub-domain-name}.onid.ca`. The \"Link in Bio\" service is mentioned here for information but does not use the subdomain structure and therefore doesn't require PSL inclusion. We are requesting PSL addition only for ONID site builder, DesignPro and enterprise solutions.\n\nAs the Sys Admin for ONID, I am responsible for overseeing our technical infrastructure.\n\n**Organization Website:** https://get.onid.ca/\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe are requesting the inclusion of our domain in the PSL for security and privacy reasons.\n\nOur platform hosts independent websites for Canadian businesses and individuals on separate subdomains (e.g., `businessname.onid.ca`), and each subdomain represents a different entity with unique content and users. Without PSL inclusion, browsers may allow cookies set by one subdomain to be accessible by other subdomains, creating potential privacy issues between our users.\n\nPSL inclusion would help with the proper cookie isolation between our users'/businesses' subdomains + prevent cross-site tracking and improving security for all users on our platform.\n\nSome examples of active client subdomains:\n\n- https://westdalecabin.onid.ca/ -> a small Canadian business\n- https://nhccareer.onid.ca/ -> a Canadian organization\n- And more can be found at Google https://www.google.com/search?q=site:onid.ca\n\nOur clients can use their assigned `businessname.onid.ca` subdomains as their main business domain; some other clients use them as staging environments before redirecting their `.onid.ca` sites to their permanent websites.\n\nWe confirm that our domain registration for onid.ca has more than 2 years remaining and we commit to maintaining it with more than 1 year of registration at all times. We will keep renewing it so it is more than 2 years all the time.\n\n```\nDomain Name: onid.ca\nRegistry Domain ID: 113203037-CIRA\nRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.ca.fury.ca\nRegistrar URL: www.hexonet.net\nUpdated Date: 2025-04-25T21:55:36Z\nCreation Date: 2024-07-05T07:46:46Z\nRegistry Expiry Date: 2027-07-05T07:46:46Z\n```\n\nVerify the RDAP records here: https://client.rdap.org/?object=onid.ca\n\nThis request is **NOT attempting to circumvent** any third-party limitations.\n\n- Our domain is already hosted on Cloudflare with almost all clients using Cloudflare proxy services.\n- We already have a wildcard SSL certificate (`*.onid.ca`) in place for all clients, so we're not seeking to bypass Let's Encrypt rate limits or any similar restrictions.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\n\n243,080 unique visitors in the past 30 days (current data from Cloudflare Web Traffic Analytics). We believe that given the size of some of our clients, the unique visitors count is more representative than the number of sub-domains."

//! rudimk: "Add `onporter.run`" "# Description of Organization\nOrganization Website: https://porter.run\n\nPorter is a fully-managed PaaS that lets teams automate DevOps, and enables them to deploy and manage apps within AWS, GCP, DO as well as on-prem infrastructure. This is accomplished by allowing users to easily orchestrate Kubernetes clusters in their own cloud accounts, and then provides a managed PaaS overlay on top.\n\nOne of the features provided by Porter are app domains, which are typically unique DNS entries provisioned on a shared domain - `onporter.run`. This allows users to quickly get started with running their apps using Porter, without the need for a custom domain right away.\n\nI handle infrastructure at Porter, and I'm making this submission on Porter's behalf.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nThe reason for this submission is cookie security. Each subdomain on `onporter.run` is technically owned by different Porter users, similar to how subdomains on web hosting services work. We'd like for our users to be able to set cookies within their own subdomains, but we certainly don't want them to set cookies for `onporter.run`, due to the risks that would pose.\n\nWe're not looking to circumvent Let's Encrypt's rate limits with this inclusion; we have separately applied to them for a rate increase, and these two requests have no bearing with each other.\n\nFinally, the `onporter.run` domain is set to expire in 2025."

E.ID is a digital identity service based on the .id domain, designed to serve as a single trusted identity in the digital world. Through E.ID, individuals and organizations can create unique sub-identities (e.g., username.e.id) that function as independent online identifiers. This service supports Indonesia’s broader digital transformation agenda by prioritizing credibility, security, and inclusivity.\n\nIam Staff programmer of Eid Team\n\n**Organization Website:**\n\nParent Company Website - https://e.id/\nPaper Website - https://idchain.id/en\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe are requesting PSL because browsers may treat e.id as a single domain, allowing cookies to be shared across all subdomains. This creates a risk of session hijacking and privacy violations. By listing E.ID in the PSL, each domainname (http://domainname.e.id/).e.id subdomain will be properly isolated, ensuring compliance with the same-origin policy and secure cookie handling. E.ID operates similarly to other public identity domains (e.g., github.io, co.uk, edu.au), where subdomains represent distinct users. To align with these precedents, PSL recognition is essential to guarantee consistent treatment across browsers, libraries, and web services.\n\nAs part of Indonesia’s digital transformation strategy, E.ID enables secure online identity for millions of potential users.

//! birdayz: "Add Redpanda Data entries for rdpa.co" "# Description of Organization\nRedpanda is a streaming data platform providing Kafka-compatible message streaming infrastructure. We operate a multi-tenant cloud service where customers provision and control dedicated cluster instances deployed under unique subdomains.\n\nI am a member of the infrastructure team at Redpanda Data, responsible for DNS infrastructure and customer cluster provisioning for our cloud platform.\n\nOur cloud platform provisions dedicated cluster instances for customers under `*.clusters.rdpa.co` (e.g., `<cluster-id>.clusters.rdpa.co`) and `*.srvrless.rdpa.co`. Each subdomain represents a customer-controlled cluster instance where the customer has full control over the data, streaming topics, connectors, and API endpoints served from that domain. Customers use these endpoints to produce and consume streaming data, manage their cluster configuration, and integrate with their applications. They can also serve user-controlled content.\n\n**Organization Website:** https://redpanda.com\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe require PSL inclusion for `*.clusters.rdpa.co` and `*.srvrless.rdpa.co` to establish proper security boundaries between customer-controlled cluster instances in our multi-tenant cloud platform.\n\nEach subdomain under these domains represents a completely separate customer-controlled cluster instance. Customers have full control over the content served from their cluster subdomain, including API endpoints, data streams, and management interfaces. Without PSL inclusion, several critical security and isolation issues arise:\n\n1. **Cookie isolation and CSRF prevention**: Cookies could leak between different customer clusters, creating cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities and potential data exposure between unrelated customers. Each customer cluster must be treated as a separate site for security purposes.\n\n2. **Browser permissions and settings isolation**: Browser permissions (storage quotas, credentials, site settings) granted to one customer's cluster could inappropriately apply to other customers' clusters, violating isolation guarantees.\n\n3. **Security reputation**: A malicious actor abusing one customer's cluster could affect the reputation and security posture of all other customers sharing the parent domain, impacting spam detection and security tooling across unrelated customer environments.\n\nEach customer cluster has independent authentication, authorization, and data. Treating these as distinct registrable domains is essential for maintaining proper security boundaries in our multi-tenant SaaS platform.\n\nThe rdpa.co domain has registration extending beyond 2 years, and we commit to maintaining the _psl DNS verification records indefinitely while these domains remain in use.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:** Thousands of clusters serving enterprise customers globally (current and growing)"

It provides customer relationship management (CRM) software and applications focused on sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics, and application development. A core component of this is Salesforce's Sales, Service, and Experience Cloud, which is an integrated software system that undergoes continuous development by around 10,000 software developers.\n\nI am Steven Lawrance, an architect on Salesforce's Sales, Service, and Experience Cloud that focuses on how the system makes use of DNS names for maximizing web security and isolation for customers in a scalable manner.\n\nOrganization Website:\n\nhttps://www.salesforce.com\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nThe Salesforce Sales, Service, and Experience Cloud system serves a large number of URL hostname patterns. To represent these in our internal development environment used by ~10,000 developers while separating the actual production and development domains, we use a URL hostname format that looks like MyDomainName.my.salesforce-com.WorkspaceID.w.crm.dev.

Our architecture provisions product deployments under subdomains such as {resourceId}.{productType}.{region}.scw.cloud, and each subdomain needs to be logically and technically isolated (e.g., for cookie boundaries, Let's Encrypt issuance, and third-party integrations).\n\nPSL inclusion ensures that third-party services and browsers properly treat each deployment as an independent origin for cookies, certificates, and security boundaries. For instance, Let's Encrypt rate-limiting treats PSL entries as boundaries for domain issuance. Without this listing, our clients face unnecessary technical constraints.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nEstimate: 10,000+ users across several enterprise clients (current and projected)"

//! martiell: "Add gov.scot to Public Suffix List" "# Description of Organization\nOrganization Website: https://www.gov.scot\n\nThe Scottish Government is the devolved government for Scotland. There is no ccTLD for Scotland, but there is a geographic gTLD: `.scot`. The gov.scot domain is used by the Scottish Government and other public sector organisations in Scotland.\n\nThe lack of ccTLD for Scotland means that this proposed entry appears in an unusual place in the list for a government domain. From the commit message:\n\n> This entry for gov.scot appears in the private domains section of the list.  This is in contrast to most `gov.*` domains in the list, which appear in the ICANN section of the list, near or alongside the relevant country code.  This is because the .scot domain is a (geographic) gTLD and the gTLD section of the list is auto-generated, so the entry for `gov.scot` cannot be added alongside the entry for `.scot`. Use of the private domains section is consistent with, for example, `service.gov.uk`.\n\nPlease see Section 4 of this \"Gov.scot domains\" publication for information about which organisations are eligible to register gov.scot domains:\nhttps://www.gov.scot/publications/govscot-domains/\n\nRegistration of gov.scot domains is handled by JISC:\n\n* Instructions:\nhttps://community.jisc.ac.uk/library/network-and-technology-service-documentation/register-govscot\n* Form: https://www.jisc.ac.uk/forms/govscot-domain-registration-form\n\nMy role is as a software engineer in the Digital directorate at the Scottish Government (possibly devops or infrastructure engineer, depending on who you ask). My responsibilities include the hosting of gov.scot and www.gov.scot web sites (the former redirecting to the latter), and coordinating DNS changes for both www.gov.scot and the gov.scot apex domain with JISC.\n\nThis change follows consultation with:\n\n* the Technical Director in the Digital Directorate;\n* the Information Security Officer in the Digital Directorate;\n* Digital Communications in the Scottish Government;\n* JISC; and\n* Demys (who provide DNS hosting for many (all?) gov.scot domains).\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\n*Cookies*: We'd like to avoid super-cookies being set on the gov.scot domain. Subdomains of gov.scot are owned by other organisations and we have concerns about the security of subdomains sharing the same cookie namespace. In particular, because some public sector services will be handling sensitive user information. Our team is responsible for web hosting of the gov.scot apex domain, so I'm also keen that we don't inadvertently set any cookies that could cause issues with the behaviour of other sites.\n\n*Consistency*: The PSL currently includes many entries of the form `gov.tld`, such as `gov.uk`. This change ensures that the gov.scot domain is handled by browsers in a way that is consistent with domains used by other governments. This helps us be more confident about security on the domain, and I understand may also have benefits browser UIs.\n\n*Let's Encrypt*: We're aware that PSL maintainers are concerned about use of the PSL to circumvent rate limits for this service. We do use Let's Encrypt at the Scottish Government, but our usage is not such that we need increased rate limits. However, we are concerned that if another public sector organisation in Scotland had a bug in their Let's Encrypt automation, then it could cause problems for us as we currently share the same usage limits with that organisation. We believe this change ensures that Let's Encrypt service limits are applied as intended, rather than something that circumvents PSL policy."

//! jacoblee93: "Add api.stdlib.com" "# Description of Organization\nOrganization Website: https://stdlib.com\n\nMy name is Jacob Lee, and I'm the co-founder of Standard Library and am in charge of platform development and architecture. The CEO of the company, Keith Horwood (@keithwhor), is the original owner of the domain and he will also comment here.\n\nStandard Library is an API development, management, and hosting platform. We support tens of thousands of developers and work closely with Slack and Stripe. Both organizations are active investors in the company and users of the product.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nEach user on our platform receives a unique hostname with the base domain where we host their deployed APIs. Though many APIs on the platform act as either JSON responses or webhook endpoints, a significant number of developers on the platform utilize our hosting capabilities to host static content (APIs can return `Content-Type: text/html` no problem). We currently run our gateway on the `lib.id` domain.\n\nWe intend to migrate all APIs to `api.stdlib.com` shortly. We would like cookie isolation at the subdomain level (`user.api.stdlib.com`). Inclusion of `api.stdlib.com` in the PSL would mitigate the risk of users setting and accessing cross site cookies that apply to other users' subdomains via the base `api.stdlib.com` domain.\n\nAs an example (and to verify success), I've created a page that attempts set a cookie named \"xdomaincookie\" for the base domain `api.stdlib.com`, and checks to see if the cookie was successfully set. It will return a success message once `api.stdlib.com` has been added to the Public Suffix List.\nhttps://jacoblee.api.stdlib.com/psltest@dev/"

All sites are provided with a `*.statichost.page` subdomain, in addition to the ability to add custom domains. statichost.eu is focused on privacy and mainly targets the European market. It is similar to services such as GitHub Pages and surge.sh, as well as Netlify and Vercel.\n\nI, the submitter, am the founder of statichost.eu.\n\n**Organization Website:**\nhttps://www.statichost.eu\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nEach site is provided with a `*.statichost.page` subdomain, e.g. `techtransparency.statichost.page` and `gobybike.statichost.page` represent separate sites. Since these subdomains are controlled by different users, we need `statichost.page` to be on the PSL to ensure that cookies are restricted to the individual subdomains and cannot be set for the main `statichost.page` domain. This is critical for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers.\n\nFurthermore, inclusion on the PSL serves as an additional signal that these subdomains are run by different entities. For instance, in the case of fraud or abuse, it should ideally limit any corrective action (such as Google Safe Browsing flagging content as dangerous) to a specific subdomain instead of the entire `statichost.page` domain.\n\nThe `statichost.page` domain has a registration term of over five years (expires in 2031), and will maintain a term of more than one year in any case.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nTens of thousands of users or more.\n\nThe direct impact of this request is to the visitors to sites that primarily use their `*.statichost.page` domain (instead of a custom domain). However, this has the potential to affect the visitors of other sites on the statichost.eu platform as well (through Google Safe Browsing, for instance).\n\nTo clarify, all existing customer subdomains will be moved to the `statichost.page` domain."

The resulting certs are provisioned on shared domains operated by Tailscale, and follow the form `<device name>.<network name>.beta.tailscale.net` and `<device name>.<network name>.ts.net`.\n\nTLS certificates may seem superfluous given that there's already an L3 VPN securing and authenticating communications, but browsers disagree: increasingly non-TLS connections result in scary warnings to users, and some newer features of the web platform are hard-disabled in \"insecure contexts\" - which browsers take to mean \"no TLS\". To avoid a downgraded web experience, Tailscale facilitates the issuance of TLS certificates by plumbing the ACME dns-01 challenge through the ts.net and beta.tailscale.net domains on behalf of user devices.\n\nIn future, we also plan to use these TLS certificates to provide \"ingress\" functionality, allowing controlled exposure of private devices to the internet while preserving e2e privacy of connections (since only the user device has the TLS private key, Tailscale merely facilitates issuance and L4 packet forwarding).\n\nI'm an engineer at Tailscale, and am making this submission on behalf of my employer. \"We\" throughout this PR refers to Tailscale as a whole, with me affirming things on the company's behalf.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe are seeking inclusion in the PSL for cookie security. Tailscale's TLS certificates are issued in two domains shared among all Tailscale users, with each user getting a distinct subdomain. As a result, `foo.ts.net` and `bar.ts.net` are owned by different users, similar to how various web host subdomains work.\n\nWe want to allow users to set cookies freely within their subdomain \"container\" on our domains, but prevent setting cookies on `ts.net` and `beta.tailscale.net`, as those cookies would leak between different users.\n\nWe have no purpose for PSL inclusion other than cookie security. In particular, we've already been granted an increased issuance rate limit with Let's Encrypt directly, and this submission is not aiming to circumvent those limits.\n\nWe understand that ts.net and tailscale.net will have to keep registration terms longer than 2 years to remain in the PSL. As of this submission, ts.net and tailscale.net expire in 2028 and 2029 respectively, and checking+renewing their registrations is included as an item in Tailscale's quarterly review of policy documents and compliance commitments.\n\nWhile the \"beta\" in beta.tailscale.net may suggest a non-production or internal domain (which wouldn't be eligible for PSL inclusion), it is in fact being used for production purposes. It predates Tailscale's acquisition of the ts.net domain, and \"beta\" was included in the name to avoid burning the entire tailscale.net domain if we made some kind of terrible mistake in how we structured user-owned subdomains. Users are currently transitioning to the ts.net domain, so in the long term I expect to be able to remove beta.tailscale.net from the PSL. However, that transition is limited by uptake of new versions of Tailscale software, and empirically, our long tail is >2 years long.\n\nThere are no past issues or PRs relating to these PSL entries, or to Tailscale more generally."

//! danderson: "Add `*.c.ts.net.`" "# Description of Organization\nOrganization Website: https://www.tailscale.com\n\nTailscale is software that creates a private overlay mesh network between users' devices, secured by the WireGuard VPN protocol.\n\nAmong other features, Tailscale gives users a subdomain within a shared DNS namespace. This is primarily to enable obtaining TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, to appease browser insistence on TLS connections even over our VPN (understandably since the browser doesn't know or care about the security properties of the IP transport).\n\nI'm an engineer at Tailscale, and am making this submission on behalf of my employer. \"We\" throughout this PR refers to Tailscale as a whole, with me affirming things on the company's behalf.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nExpansion of #1453. In working on getting our DNS/TLS features out of beta, we realized that we need multiple namespace silos, rather than just the single one that the existing `ts.net` entry describes. This is because we have multiple independent instances of the Tailscale service, and each of those instances needs its own namespace to assign to end-users.\n\nAs in #1453, the purpose of PSL inclusion is purely browser cookie security. Each of our entries describes a namespace of user-controlled subdomains, across which cookies should not propagate. We have no other purpose for PSL inclusion. In particular, we already have custom issuance limits with Let's Encrypt directly, this PR is not aimed at circumventing their rate limits.\n\nCurrently, we have 3 additional namespace silos that need cookie isolation, with 3 more in the works. To minimize the burden on the PSL, these and all future silos will exist under `<silo name>.c.ts.net`, with user-controlled domains being `<name>.<silo name>.c.ts.net`, e.g. `danderson.eu.c.ts.net` or `site19.scp.c.ts.net`.\n\nAs in #1453, we understand and reaffirm that `ts.net` will maintain a registration term longer than 2 years to remain in the PSL. Domain expiration review and renewal is part of our quarterly compliance process. As of this submission, ts.net expires in 2028. Likewise, we'll maintain `_psl` DNS records for all our PSL entries.\n\nNumber of users this request is being made to serve: 20,000-100,000. This is an estimate since we aren't using these new DNS names yet. When we start using them, they'll cover ~20,000 users immediately, growing over time as we add more silos of interest to users (e.g. silos with data locality guarantees). 100k is my guess of what we might see in the next year or so, not an upper bound."

//! ziemkowski: "Add `taveusercontent.com`" "# Description of Organization\nTave Creative Corp publishes a CRM SaaS for photographers, videographers, and other event vendors under the Táve brand. Thousands of businesses (studios) use Táve hosted contact forms, questionnaires, contracts, quotes, invoices, online scheduling, and mail to interact with their clients. The submitter, Adrian, is the founder of Táve and remains President today.\n\n**Organization Website:**\nhttp://tave.com/\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nEach brand has a `taveusercontent.com` subdomain for items they upload, such as logos for branding, custom quote PDFs for customers, or email attachments. Until a studio adds a custom domain, their Táve-generated pages still exist on `tave.com`, for example [this page](https://tave.com/concierge-onboarding/schedule/tave-demo) is at `tave.com/concierge-onboarding` but the uploaded header is always served from `concierge-onboarding.taveusercontent.com` (even if they assign a custom domain to the page itself). This separation was done a few years ago as a result of a Gmail-mandated security audit.\n\nStudios can optionally enable mail click tracking that uses a `/mail/link/:ulid` path on their user content domain, which is the most frequently abused item in these domains.\n\nCookie isolation is a plus, but my primary reason to add the domain is the hope that including the user content domain on the PSL will help prevent short-lived abuse from affecting the reputation of other studio's subdomains. We monitor and deactivate fraudulent accounts, but that can take minutes or hours to detect, and a recent set of fraudulent mail redirects caused some reputation databases to list the `taveusercontent.com` domain itself as hosting phishing content rather than the actual user subdomain it momentarily existing on, causing all users to be impacted even though the top domain returns the 404 page for all paths. None of the services have been willing to disclose if they use the PSL at all, but it would be reasonable to expect some do and this domain fits the definition of a user-registerable domain separate from our organization.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:**\nAccording to [Fathom](https://usefathom.com), 1.1m people have interacted with our client-facing pages in the past 90 days over thousands of studio domains."

I am the founder of USWC, responsible for domain. This request is submitted to ensure proper subdomain isolation for our users.\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe allocate subdomains under `obj.ag` to our users so that each user’s uploaded content is served via a unique subdomain, for example `{id}.obj.ag`. Since multiple mutually untrusting users share the base domain, we need each subdomain to be recognized as its own “cookie boundary.” By listing `obj.ag` in the PSL, browsers and other PSL consumers will treat `1.obj.ag` distinctly from `2.obj.ag`, preventing unintended cookie or security policy overlap.\n\n- The domain `obj.ag` has **more than two years** before expiration.\n- We will keep `_psl.obj.ag` TXT records in DNS for verification and to signal ongoing PSL inclusion.\n\n**Number of users served:** At the time of opening this PR, zero. However we have roughly ~5,000 waitlisted (not including their teams)."

//! baalimago: "Add `wasmer.app` to Public Suffix List" "# Description of Organization\nMy name is Lorentz Kinde and I work as SRE for Wasmer. Wasmer is an app hosting company using the [wasmer runtime](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer) as virtualization layer, instead of alternatives such as Docker. The underlying stack of Wasmer is [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), wasm. The benefit of this is the portability of wasm, the downside is that we need to make wasm POSIX compliant for full compatibility.\n\nTo make the wheels go round on this behemoth mission, we provide app hosting with [Wasmer Edge](https://docs.wasmer.io/edge). This is a distributed service orchestration system, using the aforementioned runtime as core. Via anycast we distribute workloads (apps) in regions all over the world, then run apps based on DNS:\n\n1. User creates `app-A`, based on their own codebase wasm-compiled -> uploaded to [wasmer.io](https://wasmer.io/new)\n2. App gets unique subdomain `app-A.wasmer.app`\n3. Requests route to some Edge server\n4. Edge runs workload (app) associated with `app-A`\n\n**Organization Website:** https://wasmer.io\n# Reason for PSL Inclusion\nWe make it very easy to deploy apps in multiple programming languages. This is a largely successful strategy, but it also attracts malicious users like wasps to sugar. These malicious users, and their apps, are in the vast minority yet they taint the entire `wasmer.app` domain.\n\nMitigation techniques for these malicious apps is a mix of preemptive AI agentic app scanning, manual good-old human  intervention for tricky cases and automatic banning based on some third party threat intelligence provider  partners.\n\nThis PR is a part of an effort to ensure uptime for our customers' apps (avoid DNS downtime).  We seek to make DNS registrars respond with records for our customer's apps more consistently, as we've noticed that for example [Quad9](https://quad9.net/result/?url=wasmer.app#domain-tester) flakily block us. They swap us from allow -> block automatically depending on reports by about 100 threat intelligence providers. As we remove the malicious apps, we go green, then some malicious user sneaks in an uploads a phishing app -> we go back to being red. Etc. Currently it only takes 1 malicious app to take down `wasmer.app` for hundreds of thousands of apps (at certain recursive domain name servers), which is not sustainable.\n\nThese threat intelligence providers no doubt scan PSL, so we hope that this improve our DNS availability. This is by no means an attempt to 'slack' on scanning for malicious apps. We're continuing to pursue 0 malicious apps at any given moment as we see the ability to host clean apps as a competitive edge in the b2b app hosting race.\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:** Comfortably in the 5 digits, I'm not at a position to disclose KPIs publicly  (the number of users we host apps for)"

By being listed in the PSL, browsers and other user agents will recognize each subdomain as a distinct site, thereby enforcing appropriate security boundaries and mitigating risks associated with cross-site data exposure. ​\n\nWe confirm that both domains have registration terms exceeding two years and will maintain at least one year remaining to comply with PSL requirements.​\n\nThis request is not intended to circumvent any third-party limitations, and there are no prior issues or pull requests related to this submission.​\n\n**Number of users this request is being made to serve:** 500,000+"
